Now it has the following features.

1. Wallet connection.
   It only supports MetaMask now but I will grow this to support many more wallets.
2. Mint.
   Any user can mint his/her own animal's NFT here.
3. Market.
   All animals' NFTs are listed here.
   It's very simple now, but will have many more interesting features soon.(like OpenSea)
